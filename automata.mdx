# ‚öôÔ∏è Automata: The Web Operation Engine

<Info>
Automata is the core Web Operation layer of Autoppia, powering decentralized, intelligent web automation across the internet. Built as the backbone of Subnet 36 (SN36) on Bittensor, Automata enables AI agents‚Äîcalled web operators‚Äîto interact with real websites, perform dynamic tasks, and adapt autonomously to changing web environments.
</Info>

At its essence, Automata transforms the web from a passive collection of pages into an active environment‚Äîa programmable world where AI agents can browse, extract, click, type, and execute workflows with the precision and persistence of human operators, but at a global, decentralized scale.

## üß† What Is Automata?

Automata is a revolutionary decentralized web operation protocol and AI task engine that transforms how we think about web automation. Unlike traditional automation tools, Automata creates a **living, breathing ecosystem** where AI agents can operate with human-like intelligence at machine scale.

## üß© How Automata Works

Automata operates through a sophisticated 4-stage cycle that creates a fully autonomous web operation ecosystem:

<Steps>
  <Step title="üéØ Task Definition">
    **The system defines a web-based objective**
    
    - Natural language task specification (e.g., "Go to Hacker News and list the top 3 posts")
    - Task complexity analysis and planning
    - Success criteria definition
    - Resource requirement assessment
  </Step>
  <Step title="ü§ñ Agent Execution">
    **The Autoppia SDK sends the task to a miner's agent**
    
    - Agent opens browser environment (remote or local)
    - Initial page navigation and setup
    - Task execution begins with intelligent planning
    - Real-time monitoring and logging
  </Step>
  <Step title="üîÑ Dynamic Feedback Loop">
    **Continuous screenshot ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí action cycle**
    
    - Agent captures page screenshots
    - Automata API analyzes visual content
    - AI determines next optimal action (click, type, scroll, etc.)
    - Action execution and result validation
    - Cycle repeats until task completion
  </Step>
  <Step title="üèÜ Evaluation & Reward">
    **Performance measurement and reward distribution**
    
    - Performance measured within IWA benchmark
    - Validator scoring and consensus
    - Reward distribution via Incentive Mechanism
    - Performance data feeds back for improvement
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
This architecture creates an open, competitive ecosystem where better-performing web agents earn higher rewards‚Äîdriving continuous innovation in real-world AI automation.
</Note>

## üåê Modes of Operation

Automata supports multiple execution environments, offering flexibility and privacy for both users and developers:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card icon="cloud" title="Remote Tasks" color="#2196f3">
    **Shared browser environments for scalable processing**
    
    - Hosted by miners on Subnet 36
    - Ideal for scalable, public task processing
    - No local resource requirements
    - Perfect for development and testing
  </Card>
  <Card icon="home" title="Local Tasks" color="#4caf50">
    **Direct execution on your machine with full privacy**
    
    - Uses your local Chrome profile and cookies
    - Your data never leaves your environment
    - Intelligent guidance via Automata API
    - Complete data sovereignty
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Real-World Example: Local Task

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card icon="envelope" title="Gmail to Notion Automation" color="#9c27b0">
    **"Open my Gmail, summarize new emails from clients, and add tasks to Notion"**
    
    - **Step 1**: Agent opens Gmail using your local browser
    - **Step 2**: Identifies and reads new client emails
    - **Step 3**: Generates intelligent summaries using AI
    - **Step 4**: Creates corresponding tasks in Notion
    - **Privacy**: All data processing happens locally, only summaries are shared
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
This hybrid approach ensures both decentralization and data sovereignty ‚Äî empowering users to automate safely without sacrificing control or privacy.
