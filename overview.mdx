## The Next Step in the AI Revolution

**Generative AI** has demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities. The next step is for these systems to go beyond language — to act, not just think.

This shift will redefine how people work and how software is used. Traditional tools will evolve toward more "**human**" interfaces, where users express intent and AI executes. Knowing the details of every platform will no longer matter — AI will use the software for you, letting people focus on goals, not tools.

## Autoppia — The Orchestration Layer

Companies are complex ecosystems built on expertise — sales, marketing, operations, finance, and beyond. To automate a company, we can abstract each domain into an **AI Worker**: an intelligent agent that embodies the knowledge and workflows of an expert employee.

These AI Workers are dynamic and adaptable, capable of handling varied tasks — from analysis to communication to strategy — forming the building blocks of a fully autonomous organization. A company isn't just a collection of experts; it's their **coordination** that creates value. When thinking about how to coordinate and organize a team of AI Workers to complete complex tasks, the need for an **orchestration layer emerges organically**.

Autoppia provides this coordination layer — an orchestration system that manages specialized AI Workers, aligning them toward shared objectives and enabling collaboration across domains.

## Web Operation — The Missing Piece

Most business activity happens inside **web-based platforms**: SaaS tools, CRMs, ERPs, and more. Instead of rebuilding them for AI, we teach AI to use them directly — just like humans. This is why Autoppia set in the **Web Operation** field and now is building its own web operation benchmark (Infinite Web Arena) and its own Web Operator (Autoppia Operator).

## How Everything Glues Together

Everything glues together and the result is the **Autoppia Ecosystem** — a comprehensive suite of tools and products with the endgame mission of achieving our vision: **to build an Autonomous Company**.
