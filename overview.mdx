## The Next Step in the AI Revolution

**Generative AI** has demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities. The next step is for these systems to go beyond language â€” to act, not just think.

This shift will redefine how people work and how software is used. Traditional tools will evolve toward more "**human**" interfaces, where users express intent and AI executes. Knowing the details of every platform will no longer matter â€” AI will use the software for you, letting people focus on goals, not tools.

## Autoppia â€” The Orchestration Layer

Companies are complex ecosystems built on expertise â€” sales, marketing, operations, finance, and beyond. To automate a company, we want to abstrct each domain into an **AI Worker**: an intelligent agent that embodies the knowledge and workflows of an expert employee.

These AI Workers are dynamic and adaptable, capable of handling varied tasks forming the building blocks of a fully autonomous organization. A company isn't just a collection of experts; it's their **coordination** that creates value.

When thinking about how to coordinate and organize a team of AI Workers to complete complex tasks, the need for an **orchestration layer emerges organically**.

Autoppia provides this orquestration layer -- a coordination system that manages specialized AI Workers, aligning them toward shared objectives and enabling collaboration across domains.

## Web Operation â€” The Missing Piece

Most business activity happens inside **web-based platforms**: SaaS tools, CRMs, ERPs, and more. If we want to be able to complete arbitrary and broad trasks in the bussiness environment we need AI to be able to use this softwares.

Instead of rebuilding them for AI, we teach AI to use them directly â€” just like humans. This is why Autoppia started the **Web Operation** field and now is building its own web operation benchmark (**Infinite Web Arena**) and its own Web Operator (**Autoppia Operator**). To automate everything that happens within websites.

It's a means to an end: achieving complete autonomous systems.
