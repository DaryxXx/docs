# Subnet 36 - Web Agents

<Info>
Subnet 36 (SN36) on Bittensor is Autoppia’s competitive arena for decentralized web agents. It aligns incentives so the best operators continuously emerge, improve, and ship to production use cases.

## Web Agents - SN36

We’re powering decentralized AI agents that master real-world web tasks. Bittensor Subnet 36 (SN36) is our core incentive layer, built to crowdsource the world’s best web operators.

## What are web agents?
Web agents are autonomous AI systems that interact with any website like a human: navigating dynamic pages, filling forms, extracting data, completing transactions, and adapting to changes without breaking.

Unlike rigid RPA tools that need manual programming for every step and fail on UI updates, web agents reason, decide, and execute goals intelligently. They handle surprises, edge cases, and evolving sites with zero hardcoded scripts.

## Why a Bittensor subnet?
Bittensor’s unique design aligns perfectly with our vision: turning web agent innovation into a competitive economy. Subnet 36 incentivizes miners to build and refine state-of-the-art web agents, rewarding top performers with TAO emissions.

This solves major pain points in web automation. Existing solutions often lack adaptability, rely on centralized control, and struggle to generalize. Autoppia solves this by creating a permissionless system where progress is sustainable, transparent, and driven by merit.

We’re in Bittensor because it’s the proven framework for scaling AI solutions, ensuring our agents evolve through global competition rather than isolated development.

## Bringing IWA to Bittensor

## What we’re doing in SN36
Miners submit agent models to tackle synthetic web challenges generated by our Infinite Web Arena (IWA) benchmark (e.g., "Buy a red dress under $10 on a changing e-commerce site") to enforce true generalization. Validators run these in sandboxes, score outputs on accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and speed, then update on-chain weights. Top agents get emissions via our innovative incentive mechanism.

## How Autoppia disrupts it
Current web agent solutions (e.g., OpenAI’s operator) are closed, brittle, and vendor-locked. They’re great for demos, but falter when faced with dynamic challenges. Autoppia flips this by creating a decentralized, open marketplace where agents from anywhere in the world openly compete to self-improve.

This slashes business automation costs, boosts agility across industries (e.g., e-commerce, finance, SaaS), and scales infinitely without human bottlenecks. Our goal is to release a product that enables monetization, where users pay for SOTA agents and miners earn fees. In the long run, SN36 lays the foundation for fully autonomous organizations that operate and evolve independently.
