# Web Operation

**Web Operation** is Autoppia's revolutionary capability that enables AI to interact with existing web-based software just like humans do. Instead of rebuilding business applications for AI, we teach AI to use the tools your company already knows and trusts.

<Info>
Web Operation represents the next evolution in business automation, where AI seamlessly integrates with your existing workflows rather than requiring complete system overhauls.
</Info>

## Overview

Web Operation underpins Autoppia‚Äôs automation stack by teaching agents to operate the software you already rely on. Rather than rebuild interfaces or stitch together one-off APIs, we layer reasoning and execution directly on top of live web applications.

### Traditional Challenges

Conventional automation forces teams into compromises:
- **Brittle scripts** that collapse when a button moves or copy changes
- **Costly custom integrations** limited to a handful of supported tools
- **Fragmented governance** because workflows sit outside existing systems
- **Constant human spot-checks** to keep the lights on

### Autoppia Solution

Web Operation flips the model:
- **Zero rebuild:** Agents work through native web UIs, no re-platforming required.
- **Universal coverage:** Any browser-based product becomes automatable on day one.
- **Adaptive control loops:** Agents observe, plan, and adjust as layouts shift.
- **Continuous validation:** Infinite Web Arena (IWA) stress-tests every capability.

### How It Works

Autoppia AI Workers operate through real browsers. They perceive the DOM, reason over goals, and issue actions (click, type, submit, wait) until a task is complete. The same control plane supports:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Autoppia Operator

Autoppia‚Äôs production operator packages these pillars into a unified runtime:
- **Live web control:** Deterministic browser sessions with screenshot, DOM, and action traces.
- **Goal-driven reasoning:** Chain-of-thought planning plus recovery strategies when flows diverge.
- **Cross-app orchestration:** Compose actions across multiple tools in one instruction.
- **Feedback loops:** Post-task analytics feed back into Automata and miner training sets.

## Infinite Web Arena (IWA)

## Subnet 36 - Web Agents

<Tip>
Dive deeper into network design, incentives, and benchmarks in the dedicated [Subnet 36 - Web Agents](/subnet-36-web-agents) page.
</Tip>

### Why Subnet 36 exists
Subnet 36 (SN36) is Autoppia‚Äôs incentive layer on Bittensor. It turns web agent research into an open market by rewarding the miners whose agents complete real browser tasks most reliably.

### What actually happens on SN36

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validators craft challenges">
    Infinite Web Arena generates dynamic workflows (e.g., ecommerce purchases, CRM updates, compliance checks) and wraps them in sandboxed browser sessions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Miners submit operators">
    Teams register web agents capable of reasoning through unfamiliar interfaces, handling auth, and delivering structured outputs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scoring & weighting">
    Validators grade accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and speed; scores update miner weights on-chain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rewards & learnings">
    TAO emissions flow to top performers, while telemetry feeds back into Automata and Studio workflows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why Bittensor is the substrate
- **Permissionless participation:** Anyone can launch a miner, pushing web-operation breakthroughs from around the world.
- **Transparent incentives:** On-chain weights, payouts, and logs make performance auditable.
- **Evolutionary pressure:** Competition keeps agents adapting to layout drift, policy changes, and guarded flows.

Subnet 36 transforms web automation from centralized services into a decentralized race where the best operators win on merit.

### How the Components Work Together

Together, Web Operation components form a feedback flywheel:

1. **IWA** synthesizes diverse web tasks and scores results.
2. **Automata** streams those tasks to miners and captures execution traces.
3. **Incentive Mechanism** weights validators and pays miners according to verifiable completions.
4. **Leaderboard** publishes outcomes so builders can iterate and users can trust the network.

Every loop through this cycle hardens the agents, improves evaluation coverage, and increases confidence in production deployments.

## Incentive Mechanism

The Incentive Mechanism is the economic engine behind Web Operation. It keeps agents honest, competitive, and steadily improving through transparent scoring and on-chain rewards.

- **Merit-based distribution:** Emissions stream to miners that demonstrate sustained task success.
- **Adaptive scoring:** Difficulty and weights adjust as agents improve, preventing plateaus.
- **Neutral validation:** Independent validators cross-check results before weights update.
- **Public audit trail:** Every score and payout lives on-chain for community review.

## Automata

### ‚öôÔ∏è Automata: The Web Operation Engine

<Info>
Automata is the execution layer for Web Operation. It coordinates browsers, agents, and validators across Subnet 36 (SN36) so AI operators can browse, click, type, and complete workflows with human-level precision‚Äîwithout central control.
</Info>

Automata treats the web as a programmable environment. Agents receive observations, plan their next move, and dispatch actions until a task is complete. That loop keeps running even as DOMs shuffle, captchas appear, or network conditions change.

### üß† What Is Automata?

Automata is a decentralized web-operation protocol that enables agents to:

- Navigate live websites through deterministic browser sessions
- Execute multi-step workflows that depend on reasoning, long-term memory, and context
- Extract structured data, transform results, and hand off outputs to downstream systems
- Recover from layout drift, dynamic components, and guarded workflows
- Respect security boundaries by keeping credentials in the user‚Äôs control

Each Automata task mirrors a real-world interaction‚Äîlogging into portals, triaging tickets, handling procurement, reconciling finances. Instead of a static API, Automata is a living benchmark and runtime that trains, evaluates, and rewards agents on the real internet.

### üß© How It Works

Automata composes several subsystems into an autonomous control loop:

<Steps>
  <Step title="üéØ Task Definition">
    A validator or user defines a goal (e.g., ‚ÄúLocate the latest purchase order and export it as CSV‚Äù).
  </Step>
  <Step title="ü§ñ Agent Execution">
    The Autoppia SDK dispatches the task to a miner‚Äôs agent, which launches a remote or local browser and starts operating.
  </Step>
  <Step title="üîÑ Dynamic Feedback Loop">
    Observation ‚Üí policy planning ‚Üí action. Automata repeats this loop, adapting to new states until the objective is satisfied or aborted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="üèÜ Evaluation & Reward">
    Infinite Web Arena scores the attempt, validators reach consensus, and rewards or penalties propagate through the Incentive Mechanism.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This architecture fuels an open marketplace where the best-performing agents rise quickly, learn from mistakes, and share improvements back with the network.

### üåê Modes of Operation

Automata supports multiple execution environments so teams can balance privacy, speed, and cost:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card icon="cloud" title="Remote Tasks">
    Run tasks inside miner-hosted browsers‚Äîideal for large-scale experimentation or workloads that do not require local credentials.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="home" title="Local Tasks">
    Execute tasks on your machine using your Chrome profile, cookies, and policies. Data never leaves your environment while Automata provides the control loop.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Example local workflow: ‚ÄúOpen my Gmail, summarize new client emails, and create follow-up tasks in Notion.‚Äù Automata coordinates the browser while credentials stay on-device.
</Info>

### üß∞ Developer Integration

Developers reach Automata through the Autoppia SDK, a lightweight Python package on PyPI:

```bash
pip install autoppia
```

The SDK ships with:

- A production-ready client for API-based and local task execution
- Templates and logging utilities for building custom agents
- Native bridges into Autoppia Studio, Worker deployments, and Miner tooling
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) adapters so assistants like Claude, Sonnet, or Cursor can call Automata

```python
from autoppia import AutomataClient

client = AutomataClient(local=True)
client.run_task("Open Freshdesk, triage new tickets, and assign priorities")
```

### üîÅ Integration with Infinite Web Arena

Automata powers the Infinite Web Arena (IWA), Autoppia‚Äôs benchmark for evaluating web agents at scale. IWA continuously generates dynamic, synthetic websites with changing layouts, randomized content, and adaptive structures that prevent overfitting. Agents must conquer this living benchmark to climb the public [Leaderboard](/leaderboard).

### üîê Security & Privacy

Automata is built with privacy by default:

- **Local execution:** Keep credentials, tokens, and cookies within your perimeter.
- **Encrypted transport:** All API communication is secured end-to-end.
- **Deterministic replay:** Validators can replay sessions for transparent scoring.
- **Trusted hardware roadmap:** TEE-based execution is on the roadmap for regulated workloads.

### üß± Why Automata Matters

Automata introduces a new class of AI infrastructure: decentralized, agentic, and web-native. Where RPA scripts are fragile and closed bots lack adaptability, Automata agents learn like humans yet scale like cloud software‚Äîunlocking autonomous digital labor across the web.

Through Automata, Autoppia is building an open marketplace where agents can:

- Tackle complex workflows across live internet properties
- Interact with enterprise systems and SaaS tools in situ
- Learn continuously from validator feedback and telemetry
- Generate measurable value and fee revenue for builders

### üß≠ What‚Äôs Next

- **Dynamic Zero incentives (live):** winner-takes-all emissions with anti-gaming safeguards
- **Expanded dashboards:** richer validator analytics, miner drill-downs, and alerts
- **New benchmarks:** additional verticals beyond ecommerce, support, and finance
- **Training sandbox:** reinforcement-learning environment for rapid policy iteration
- **Studio workflows:** one-click task authoring and deployment from Autoppia Studio

### üöÄ Web Autonomy

Automata is the engine behind Autoppia‚Äôs vision‚Äîa decentralized world where AI agents autonomously operate across the web, execute real tasks, and learn from every interaction. It is more than automation; it is Web Autonomy.
